#### This C++ simulation is an adaptation of the FORTRAN CRUISE5   ####
#### program, which was originally provided for my book            ####
#### "Modeling and Simulation of Aerospace Vehicle Dynamics". For  ####
#### the third Edition it was converted for the CADAC++ framework. ####
#### It is 'Academic Software' and can be used and modified freely ####

* Release 3.0, 3 July 2013
	Built with MS Visual C++ 10; compatible with MS Visual C++ 8 & 9

* Features of simulation
	* 3 DoF, round, rotating earth; coordinates: longitude, latitude, altitude
	* Cruise missile:
		drag polars, functions of Mach
		turbojet propulsion deck
		controllers: flight path angles, accelerations, altitude
		guidance: line guidance, point guidance, arc guidance, pro-nav
		seeker: simple line-of-sight 
	* Targets fixed, constant speed or accelerated
	* Satellites orbiting the Earth, providing coordinates of (moving) targets 
	* This simulation is used in it's FORTRAN version in my book, but has much extended
	  capabilities, however the simple INS/GPS model is not included  
	* For detailed instructions and derivations of this C++ version, see my
	  Self_Study Course "Building..." (reference below)

EXECUTION:	* Build a project in the Visual C++ Editor with the provided source code
			* Execute with file 'input.asc' located in the projet directory
			* Plot results of output 'plot1.asc' or 'traj.asc' with KPLOT (CADAC Studio)

OPTIONS:	* inguid1.asc Waypoint/line guidance against GPS target coordinates 
			* insat2.asc 1 missile vs 2 target with 2 passive satellites
			* insat3.ac 2 crs,2 trgt,2 sat; sats replace last waypoint, seeker terminal
						 			     
PLOTTING:   Install KPLOT from CADAC4/Studio (free download from AIAA.org)
