#### This C++ simulation is an adaptation of the FORTRAN SRAAM6    ####
#### program, which was originally provided for my book            ####
#### "Modeling and Simulation of Aerospace Vehicle Dynamics". For  ####
#### the third Edition it was converted for the CADAC++ framework. ####
#### It is 'Academic Software' and can be used and modified freely ####
